Also, does the management team receive a report on the status of the separate management of the Users’Property, etc. on a regular or as-needed basis and use it in developing a system to properly implement the separate management of the Users’ Property, etc. (including the establishment of an internal checking function)?
- (2) General viewpoints relating to separate management
    - (i) Do the internal rules of the Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider specifically provide for how to implement the separate management for each type of money and Crypto-Assets? In addition, are they reflected in the contract with each user?
    - (ii) Doesthe Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider clearly separate money and Crypto-Assets, which is its own property, from the Users’Property, etc. based on the implementation methods set forth in (i) above? And can the balance of money and/or the quantity of Crypto-Assets of individual users be ascertained immediately? Does the Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider properly verify its compliance status?
    - (iii) Are the Crypto-Assets that the Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider holds as its own property and the Performance-Guarantee Crypto-Assets clearly separated based on the implementation methods in (i) above? In addition, is it possible to identify immediately which one is the Performance-Guarantee Crypto-Assets? Does the Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider properly verify its compliance status?

In addition, does the Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider take measures to relocate and shift the persons responsible on a regular basis from the perspectives of preventing problematic conducts and wrongful acts?
- (3) Supervisory viewpoints regarding separate management of Crypto-Assets deposited by users (hereinafter referred to as the “Entrusted Crypto-Assets”) and Performance Guarantee CryptoAssets
    - (i) With regard to separate management in the case where Entrusted Crypto-Assets and Performance Guarantee Crypto-Assets (hereinafter referred to as the “Target Crypto-Assets”) are managed by the Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider itself, does the Provider make sure to manage the Target Crypto-Assets in a different wallet from the wallet in which its own Crypto-Assets (excluding Performance Guarantee Crypto-Assets; hereinafter the same shall apply in (i)) are managed? Does the Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider store the wallet for managing its own Crypto-Assets and the wallet for managing the Target Crypto-Assets in clearly segregated storages, respectively? For example, one conceivable way is to clearly separate devices for storing the wallets.
    - (ii) With regard to separate management in the case where management of the Target CryptoAssets is entrusted to a third party, does the Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider make sure to have the third party manage the Target Crypto-Assets in a different wallet from the wallet in which Crypto-Assets other than the Target Crypto-Assets are managed? Does Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider have the third party store the wallet for managing the Target Crypto-Assets and the wallet for managing Crypto-Assets other than the Target Crypto-Assets in clearly segregated storages, respectively? For example, one conceivable way is to clearly separate devices for storing the wallets.
    - (iii) With regard to the management of the Target Crypto-Assets, has the Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider taken necessary measures to prevent a situation in which the current quantity of the Target Crypto-Assets on networks such as a blockchain falls short of the balance of the Target Crypto-Assets on the books managed by the Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider due to circumstances such as a case where transaction details are not reflected in networks such as a blockchain?
    - Note: In light of the self-regulatory rules of the Japan Virtual and Crypto assets Exchange Association “Rules on Management of Users’ Property relating to the Crypto-Asset Exchange Services,” conceivable necessary measures, for example, can include a measure by which the Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider stipulates in its internal rules the quantity of Crypto-Assets necessary to prevent a situation in which the current quantity of the Target Crypto-Assets on networks such as a blockchain falls short of the balance of the Target Crypto-Assets on the books managed by the Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider, while also commingling its own Crypto-Assets of the same type and up to the same quantity as the relevant Crypto-Assets’ in the wallet for managing the Target Crypto-Assets. (If the commingling exceeds said quantity, such commingling must be eliminated within five business days from the day following the date of occurrence.)
    - (iv) With regard to the management of the Target Crypto-Assets, does the Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider reconcile the balance of the Target Crypto-Assets on the books managed by the Provider and the current quantity of the Target Crypto-Assets on networks such as a blockchain every business day? In addition, in cases where the reconciliation has revealed the current quantity of the Target Crypto-Assets is less than the balance of the Target CryptoAssets on the books, despite the measure set forth in (iii) above, does the Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider analyze the cause and promptly resolve the shortfall?
    - Note: Such shortfall shall be resolved within five business days (in the case where the user can pay out the Entrusted Crypto-Assets within a period shorter than five business days based on the contract, such period) from the day immediately following the day of such shortfall.
    - (v) In cases where the Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider manages the Target CryptoAssets on its own, does the Provider adopt any appropriate management methods to prevent the Target Crypto-Assets from being leaked to the outside, such as by recording and managing the secret keys, etc. necessary for transferring the Target Crypto-Assets on electronic devices that are always unconnected to the Internet, or by means of other equivalent technical security measures, except for the Entrusted Crypto-Assets that satisfy the requirements specified in Article 63-11(2) of the Act and Article 27(2) of the Cabinet Office Order (hereinafter referred to as the “Target Entrusted Crypto-Assets”)? Note that electronic devices, etc. that have been connected to the Internet even once do not fall under “electronic devices, etc. that are always unconnected to the Internet”.
    - Note: Whether an “equivalent technical security measure” has been taken needs to be substantively determined for each individual case in light of the actual situation. However, as an example, the following case is conceivable: While secret keys, etc. necessary to transfer Target Crypto-Assets are recorded and managed in an electronic device, etc. connected to the Internet only at the time of signature, the secret keys, etc. recorded in such electronic device, etc. are in a technical specification that can be signed in such electronic device, etc. without being transferred from such electronic device, etc. to the outside at all, and moreover the authenticity of transaction details is confirmed each time, as they are made by manually signing with such secret keys, etc.
    - (vi) In cases where a Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider entrusts the management of the Target Crypto-Assets to a third party, does the third party manage the Target Crypto-Assets, except for the Target Entrusted Crypto-Assets, in a manner that is reasonably deemed to ensure the same level of the user protection as in the case where the Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider manages them on its own, in terms of protection of the Target CryptoAssets?
    - Note: Whether the manner corresponds to “a manner that is reasonably deemed to ensure the same level of the user protection as in the case where the Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider manages them on its own” needs to be substantively determined for each individual case in light of the actual situation. However, for example, the following cases are conceivable.
        - • Case where a Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider entrusts the management of the Target Crypto-Assets to another Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider and where there is an agreement that the Target Crypto-Assets under the management of the other Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider will be promptly returned to the entrusting Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider in the event of the bankruptcy of the entrusting Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider or on the occurrence of other certain causes
        - • Case where a Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider entrusts the Target CryptoAssets to a trust company or the like and where the respective users of the CryptoAsset Exchange Service Provider will receive the Target Crypto-Assets in trust as the beneficiaries in the event of the bankruptcy of the Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider or on the occurrence of certain other causes
    - (vii) Upon the occurrence of a situation where the whole or part of the Target Crypto-Assets excluding the Target Entrusted Crypto-Assets are managed by methods other than those described in (v) and (vi) above, does the Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider resolve the situation within one business day from the day following the day on which the situation occurred?
    - (viii) In cases where a Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider entrusts management of the Target Crypto-Assets to a third party, does the Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider confirm that the entrusted third party complies with the matters listed in (2)(i) through (iii) and (v) above as well as (3)(ii) through (iv), (vi) and (vii) above, and that necessary responses to leakage risks are taken in accordance with II-2-2-4?
- (4) Separate Management Audits
    - (i) Does the Crypto-Asset Exchange Service Provider have necessary internal frameworks to deal with Separate Management Audits (which collectively refer to the separate management audit prescribed in Article 28(1) of the Cabinet Office Order and the audit of separate management of Performance Guarantee Crypto-Assets prescribed in Article 30 of the Cabinet Office Order; the same shall apply hereinafter)? (Such frameworks include, but are not limited to, the formulation of internal rules and manuals, and the establishment of response divisions.)
    - (ii) Are important matters identified and pointed out in Separate Management Audits reported without delay to the Board of Directors and company auditors or the Board of Company Auditors?
    - (iii) Are matters pointed out in Separate Management Audits improved within a certain period of time? In addition, does the Internal Audit Department properly grasp and verify the improvement status of the audit findings?
    - Note: Audit reports must be submitted to the competent Local Finance Bureau within four months from the base date of Separate Management Audits, in light of the selfregulatory rules of the Japan Virtual and Crypto assets Exchange Association “Rules on the Management of Users’ Property Pertaining to the Crypto-Asset Exchange Services.”
